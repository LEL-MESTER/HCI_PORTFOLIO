* #### The logo is meant to represent a government building, which is built upon the letters “M” and “A”.
* #### In the middle, the letter “S” is located, which represents a Safe, if we combine these three letters we form “Mas”, which means “More” in Spanish and Filipino.
* #### At the bottom are located the letters “A”, “F”, “E”. When combined with the “S”, forms the word “Safe”. Delivering the name “MasSafe”.
* #### Finally, our overall shape is a shield, which symbolizes a secure service to our customers.
